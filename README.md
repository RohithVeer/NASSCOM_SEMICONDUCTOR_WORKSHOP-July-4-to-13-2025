##  Semiconductor Package Construction – Visual Stack

Below is the **visual representation of package construction** from **top to bottom**, illustrating each physical layer of a typical wire-bonded package.

| Layer | Description | Image |
|-------|-------------|-------|
|  **Mold Compound** | Encapsulates and protects the internal components from mechanical and environmental damage. | ![Mold Compound](./MoldCompound.png) |
|  **Bondwire** | Thin gold/aluminum wires used to connect the die pads to the substrate/package leads. | ![Bondwire](./Bondwire.png) |
|  **Die** | The silicon chip that contains the functional circuitry. | ![Die](./Die.png) |
|  **Die Bond Pad** | Metal pads on the die for electrical interconnection via bonding wires. | ![Die Bond Pad](./DieBondpad.png) |
|  **Die Attach** | Adhesive or solder layer that secures the die to the substrate. | ![Die Attach](./DieAttach.png) |
|  **Substrate** | The base platform that supports the die and routes electrical signals to the PCB. | ![Substrate](./Substrate.png) |

> Each of these layers plays a critical role in signal transmission, heat dissipation, and mechanical reliability.
